## Team: VII Technologies 
## Overview
This project leverages Earth observation data to assess and visualize high-risk zones for land degradation, drought, and climate change in the Sahel. By providing insurance agencies with data-driven insights, we aim to improve risk assessment and the design of insurance products tailored for farmers, herders, and pastoralist groups.

## Approach
We utilize satellite imagery and climate data to create a risk assessment dashboard that highlights vulnerable areas. By integrating historical trends and real-time updates, we help stakeholders make informed decisions about land management and insurance pricing.

## Key Features
✅ Risk Visualization Dashboard – Interactive map displaying high-risk zones.
✅ Insurance Risk Profiles – Data-driven insights to support risk assessment.
✅ Land Degradation Analysis – Trends and insights to promote resilience.

## Methodology
### Data Acquisition & Processing

- MODIS Land Cover Change Data (MCD12Q1) – Identifying desertification trends.
- CHIRPS Climate Precipitation Data – Understanding drought-prone regions.
## Data Analysis & Visualization

- Processing datasets using Python.
- Generating interactive risk heatmaps with Plotly.
## Final Implementation

- Validating insights with historical drought and insurance claim data.
- Deploying a user-friendly visualization tool for sustainable land management.
